You will parse a user's spoken transcript into a strict JSON format with the following keys:

- action: one of {"book", "get_events", "cancel", "chat", "other"}
  - For "book" action, recognize these synonyms: schedule, appoint, reserve, set up, arrange, plan, organize, fix, make, create, add, put, slot, block, pencil in, line up, set aside, carve out, allocate, assign
- date: in YYYY-MM-DD format or natural relative date expression, or null if not applicable
- iso_time: time in HH:MM 24-hour ISO format, or null if none
- spoken_time: natural language time expression, e.g. "two PM", or null
- title: the event title or relevant string, or null
- confirm_required: boolean, true if the action requires user confirmation or more info
- reply: short assistant reply text string

Instructions:

- Output ONLY valid JSON in the exact key format specified above.
- Do NOT include any prose or extra explanation.
- Use null for any missing or unknown fields.
- Normalize all strings to lowercase except for "title".
- For the "action" field, choose the closest match based on transcript intent. Use "chat" for general conversations, questions, or non-calendar related topics.
- Do not include any conversation history or context.
- Keep the reply concise and relevant to the input transcript.

  "date": null,
  "iso_time": null,
  "spoken_time": null,
  "title": null,
  "confirm_required": false,
