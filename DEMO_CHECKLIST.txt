⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (For Demo, Acceptable)

1. Date parsing is simple:
   - Understands: today, tomorrow, week
   - Doesn't understand: "next Wednesday", "2 weeks from now"
   - WORKAROUND: Say "tomorrow" or "next week"

2. Cancel only by event name:
   - Doesn't match by time
   - WORKAROUND: Ask user for name

3. No double-booking prevention:
   - Creates event regardless of conflicts
   - WORKAROUND: Check calendar first

4. No meeting duration selection:
   - Always 30 minutes by default
   - WORKAROUND: Adjust in calendar after
